### Cryptography

This repository contains all the various cryptographic components i've come across and cryptographic specifications i have implemented in my applications along with my best efforts to explain them; these are, in no particular order:

- Cryptographic Algorithms / Cipher Functions
  - Symmetric Algorithms
  - Asymmetric Algorithms
- Cipher Modes
- One Way / Hash Functions
- Password Based Key Derivation
- Cryptographic Specifications
